Steps for using PHP to decode the JWT returned by AWS Cognito service. 
First you need to setup a User Pool in AWS. Plenty of online tutorials for this. 

Once the User Pool is setup, you will need the following parameters for the login page code. 

In User Pool - > App Integration -> 

App Client Settings
=========================================
App client Id: 7k9aruc3ok5fj0dh849pe8tfth
Callback URL(s) : https://yourwebapp.com/awsLogin.php

Domain Name
============
Amazon Cognito domain : https://yourwebapp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com

Note. Currently this code does not verify the token. This will be the next part. 


Steps
=========

1) Have a login button on your website. It will have this link.


<Amazon Cognito Domain>/login?response_type=code&client_id=<App client Id>&redirect_uri=<callback URL>&state=STATE&scope=openid+profile+email+aws.cognito.signin.user.admin

Example:
https://yourwebapp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/login?response_type=code&client_id=7k9aruc3ok5fj0dh849pe8tfth&redirect_uri=https://yourwebapp.com/awsLogin.php&state=STATE&scope=openid+profile+email+aws.cognito.signin.user.admin

2) Clicking on above link will take user to either signin or create an account. If login is performed, after AWS authenticates the login, it will redirect you to the callback URL. 
In this example the call back URL is awsLogin.php. 

It will pass a JWT Token.  

3) The JWT token is then used to perform auth request. Using the token, and some other parameters, we perform the HTTPS request, and get returned another JWT token. 

The auth request is as follows (handled in awsLogin.php).

https://yourwebapp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token

The following parameters must be sent with the above oauth request (application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameters)

grant_type – Set to “authorization_code” for this grant.				                       "authorization_code"
code – The authorization code that’s passed to awsLogin.php after step 1.   				   "4357b5e1-b2d1-4a3e-8f70-4546373"
client_id – Same as from the request in step 1.							                            7k9aruc3ok5fj0dh849pe8tfth	
redirect_uri / call back URL – Same as from the request in step 1.						          https://airwatch.io/awsLogin.php


After sucessfull HTTPS request a JWT Token is returned. 

This has 5 parts.
 "id_token"
 "access_token"
 "refresh_token"
 "expires_in"
 "token_type"


The code in awsLogin.php decodes the "id_token" and prints these parts:

at_hash
sub
email_verified
iss
cognito_username
origin_jti
aud
token_use
auth_time
exp
iat
jti
email


I then use email in users session.
